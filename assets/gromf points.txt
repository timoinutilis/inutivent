Gromf helps you inviting friends to your events, without registration and without collecting personal data.


Why using Gromf?

-There is no registration and Gromf doesn't want any passwords.
-There are no user profiles. Gromf is really not into personal information.
-Gromf only asks for e-mail addresses to send invitations, he doesn't even try to remember them.
-Gromf doesn't care where you have gone before, he keeps user information separated for each event.
-Gromf is hungry and won't wait more than 30 days after the event's end to eat all data. Nothing will be left!


How does it work?

When you create an event and invite people to it, you and every guest will receive an e-mail with a personal link to the webpage of the event. This link already includes a number to identify the person, thatâ€™s why there is no need to log-in. These identification numbers are automatically created with every new event and with every invitation.
Warning: The priority of Gromf is not protecting data (no passwords, no secure connections), but making it anoymous and temporal. Don't publish very private information! For any doubts you can contact me by e-mail.
