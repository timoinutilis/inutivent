Gromf helps you inviting friends to your events, without registration and without collecting personal data.


Why?

-There is no registration and Gromf doesn't want any passwords.
-There are no user profiles. Gromf is really not into personal information.
-Gromf only asks for e-mail addresses to send invitations, he doesn't even try to remember them.
-Gromf doesn't care where you have gone before, he keeps user information separated for each event.
-Gromf is hungry and won't wait more than 30 days after the event's end to eat all data. Nothing will be left!


How does it work?

When you create an event you will receive an e-mail with a personal link to access and edit your event. When you invite people everybody will get an e-mail with a personal link, too. E-mail addresses are never saved on the server. For each event independent users are created on the server, there is no connection between user data of different events.

Warning: The personal links are the keys of this website, there is no password protection. Don't publish very private information! For any doubts you can contact me by e-mail.
